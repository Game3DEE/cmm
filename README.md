# View3DN

## TODO

* on 16-bit to 32-bit texture conversion, use faces (uv coords + flags) to create alpha channel
* billboard handling: check billboard in CAR/3DF file?
* Clean up ETC1 code, use offsets instead of generating new Uint8Array's all the time

## Community suggestions:

* Add support for multiple textures (then allow to switch between them)
